typealias PrivacyPreferences = Dictionary<String, Bool>

/*
 Privacy preferences are stored in UserDefaults as a String:Bool mapping, where
 String is the unique key of the privacy option (PrivacyOption.rawValue) and Bool
 is whether or not the option is enabled.
 
 TO SET PRIVACY OPTIONS: use the UserDefaults.standard.setPrivacyOption() method.
 
 After setting privacy options, you should attempt to send the changes to the server.
 Do this with UserDBManager.shared.saveUserPrivacySettings()
 
 TO FETCH PRIVACY OPTIONS: use UserDBManager.shared.syncUserSettings() to pull settings
 from the database. Then use UserDefaults.standard.getPreference(forOption) to get
 individual preferences values for each option.
